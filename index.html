                <p class="paragraph">COVID-19 otherwise known as the coronavirus and scientifically named severe
                    acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
                    began spreading in the city of Wuhan in the province of Hubei, China in early December 2019 as the
                    first human cases were recorded. Subesquently the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the
                    coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on the 30th of
                    January, 2020 and since then the pandemic has spread all over the world causing the largest public
                    health emergency in living history[1].
                    <br><br>
                    For governments around the world, the advice from the WHO in response to the coronavirus pandemic
                    was to limit human contact, travel and social activity along with the wearing of face-masks and
                    constant hand washing or sanitising and good hygeine. As the virus spreads easily from human to
                    human, the best way to avoid contracting the coronavirus is to limit contact with other people as
                    much as possible. In the absence of effective treatments or a vaccine, governments rely on public
                    policy to contain the spread of the coronavirus. The policies used by governments around the world
                    are known as "lockdowns".
                    <!-- where under a government sanctioned state of disaster or emergency or 
                    something similar to this certain stores and markets, public places and areas of social congregation 
                    etc. are required to close and people are to stay at home, avoiding unnecessary places of work and 
                    avoiding social engagement and human contact until their government deems it appropriate to call an 
                    end to it. -->
                    <br><br>
                    Different Governments around the world have different styles of lockdown, implementing a lockdown at
                    different times, and keeping their cities in lockdown for different amounts of time, while some
                    don't
                    lockdown at all. Lockdowns vary quite broadly depending on the politics of the people in power, the
                    people who live in those countries and cities, and the perceived threat of the coronavirus versus
                    the
                    psychosociological and economical problems that a lockdown presents. We do not
                    have the
                    luxury or knowledge of hindsight from any historical events where large lockdowns were implemented
                    in the
                    containment of an infectious virus and most decisions made have been from hypothetical but logical and 
                    somewhat accurate models of how to slow the spread of the virus, therefore I have found it important to attempt to perform this data
                    analysis so as to understand the effectiveness and side-effects of such measures.
                    <!-- <br><br>
                    As it is understood that the coronavius is less infectious during the warmer seasons and more infectious 
                    particularly during winter, I will begin with a comparison of the Southern and Northern Hemisphere and 
                    how the data over the last year relates to a study analysis of Seasonal Influenza Epidemics and El Niños 
                    by hemisphere using the same countries analysed in that study.
                    <br><br>
                    I will then be analysing 9 countries coronavirus data, their rolling 7 day average of new confirmed cases 
                    and deaths due to coronavirus, as well as their excess mortality rate, and changes in data from 2019 to 
                    2020 of their unemployment rate, youth unemployment rate and GDP. 3 of the countries 
                    will be selected to represent data from "long" lockdowns, another 3 for "short" lockdowns and the final 3 
                    for having implemented no lockdown at all.
                    <br><br>
                    Due to my own personal experience during the coronavirus, I will then analyse data from 3 different places 
                    I have been during three key moments in the cornavirus timeline: China when the outbreak of the virus began 
                    and my first lockdown experience, then Australia in Melbourne during the winter of the southern hemisphere 
                    in lockdown and now currently in Portugal during the winter of the northern hemisphere and another lockdown. -->

                    to ingest via

                    The image above is a set of graphs from the study which shows that the number of cases of influenza
                    peaks in the winter months in both the southern and northern hemisphere, highest in January for the
                    north and
                    July in the south.
                    <br><br>
                    Following this is mapped out a 7 day rolling average of new coronavius cases per million people in
                    the same countries
                    starting with the peak of the virus in China on the 17th of February, when it began to become
                    evident to be spreading
                    to other countries around the world.
                    At this time, there were only lockdowns in place within China while travel from China was becoming
                    increasingly restricted.

                    <br><br>
                    Over the winter in the southern hemisphere on the 30th of July it is clear to see that in South
                    America and Southern Africa
                    the virus had a higher rate of infection than anywhere in the northern hemisphere apart from the
                    United States, while Australia's
                    infection rate was a lot higher in the winter than what is recorded during the summer of the
                    southern hemisphere on the 24th of January, 2021.
                    At this time, we can also see that during the winter in the northern hemisphere, the number of new
                    cases in Europe and North America
                    was at it's worst across the board apart from in China, which had implemented a very strict lockdown
                    during the first wave of
                    infections on the 23rd through to March 8th in the province of Hubei. Although India seems to have
                    had a somewhat similar rate of infection over the year
                    likely because of it's proximity to the equator and not experiencing such large fluctuations in
                    temperature over the year.
                    Many of these countries have implemented various degrees of lockdowns and restrictions over the time
                    period and in the following chapter I
                    will be analysing a broad range of countries from all over the planet and what effect lockdowns have
                    had.

                <h1 class="article">_<br>Lockdowns</h1>
                <h2 class="sub">What is a Lockdown?</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">A lockdown is "a temporary condition imposed by governmental authorities (as during
                    the outbreak of
                    an epidemic disease) in which people are required to stay in their homes and refrain from or limit
                    activities outside
                    the home involving public contact (such as dining out or attending large gatherings)"[3]. When a
                    lockdown is imposed, its
                    enforced by law and requires the shutdown of parts of the economy. There can be travel restrictions,
                    stay-at-home orders,
                    curfews, cancellation of recreational venues, closing of public spaces, closing of non-essential
                    production, closing of
                    schools and kindergartens, social distancing and border closures[4]. Many countries have imposed
                    some form of lockdown
                    on their citizens, whether it be on the national, state, province, regional or metropolitan level.
                    <br><br>
                    For the purpose of this analysis, I have distinguised lockdowns based upon the only singularly
                    cohesive source of information for
                    lockdowns by country that I could find, which was Wikipedia[5]. This is due to the fact that there
                    is no luxury of a dataset or cohesive
                    source of information based on past events, as the world is still in the middle of the pandemic. The
                    lockdowns I have chosen to
                    analyse are in regards to strict lockdown conditions, while many if not all governments have
                    restrictions in place in regards to
                    dealing with the coronavirus.

                    "Flattening the curve" otherwise known as "community mitigation" is a term coined by the Center for
                    Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
                    in the United States in regards to making sure that the health care system of the country remains
                    capable of coping
                    with the amount of people who are in need of hospitilisation during the pandemic, as each country
                    only has a limited capacity
                    for providing health care to individuals at any one time due to the amount of hospitals, beds,
                    doctors, nurses and ventilators that
                    may be available. This is one of the main reasons for a government to implement a strict lockdown as
                    the amount of infection cases increase,
                    which they can exponentially. Lockdowns have shown to slow the rate of infection within a
                    population[6].
                    <br><br>
                    Below is a simple graphic example of the logic behind "flattening the curve"
                    <img src="./assets/images/flattenthecurve.svg" alt="Flattening the Curve" class="flatcurve">
                    <br>
                    In this analysis I have decided to compare 6 countries that have implemented lockdowns in duration
                    (as a total sum of all lockdowns in the country itself)
                    over 50 days, 6 countries that have implemented lockdowns for a total under 50 days as well as 6
                    countries that have not implemented lockdowns at all.
                    Countries have been chosen based upon their population and range of global influence and varying
                    geographical locations in order to get a more
                    equalateral view of the pandemic and how lockdowns might mitigate the risk of infection.
                </p>
                <h2 class="sub">Long Lockdowns</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Long Lockdowns have been categorised (in this analysis) as being a total of 50 or more days in
                    lockdown in total in one country. Regardless of where the lockdown
                    was imposed within the country itself, for the purpose of the simplification of the data I have
                    aggregated metropolitan, regional, state and national
                    lockdowns into the one country's profile. In the northern hemisphere I have decided upon comparing
                    India, the UK, France, Italy, and the Philippines. In the
                    south I have decided upon Brazil (Australia will be analysed in focus later in the study).

                    The below graph shows the daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases per million people and dates of
                    implementation, and realease of lockdowns by the countries outlined above

                    <br>
                    As we can see above in the beginning of the outbreak from March the numbers of coronavirus cases
                    began to rise, and in reaction to this the countries imposed
                    lockdowns onto their citizens. Each country has its own unique variables associated with how the
                    coronavirus may be transmitted and become a problem again after the
                    first initial lockdowns, although it is evidently required to have multiple lockdowns in a country
                    if the cases of coronavirus are exponentially increasing.
                    A lockdown is only as good as the awareness. There is some community mitigation evident in the
                    second wave of lockdowns, which has had an effect on France
                    and Italy, alough the UK seems to have been unable to contain the contageon until very recently.

                    In the northern hemisphere I have decided upon comparing Russia, Vietnam and Iran. In the
                    south I have decided upon South Africa, Ezuador and New Zealand.

                    In the data visualisation above, we can see the effect of implementing a lockdown out of season,
                    with South Africa having imposed a lockdown from late March
                    until the end of April 2020. The number of cases, as is expected along with the winter for the
                    southern hemisphere in July peaked at over 200 cases per million.
                    Although at this time, they did not attempt to implement another lockdown, and when the warmer
                    months came, the cases lowered only to rise exponentially again
                    in the winter. Russia, who implemented a lockdown at the end of March like many others, with cases
                    decreasing over the summer for the northern hemisphere did
                    not implement another lockdown and saw an increase in cases over the winter, although it is
                    speculative to consider wether a lockdown would have done much to change the spread
                    of the coronavirus considering the UK's unfruitful lockdown efforts.

                    No Lockdowns have been categorised (in this analysis) as being a total of 0 days in lockdown in one

                    In the northern hemisphere I have decided upon comparing Sweden, Japan, Estonia and South Korea. In
                    the

                    Here we are able to see that lockdowns might not have much effect over the spread of the coronavirus
                    with similar if not less cases per million people than those
                    countries that did impose long lockdowns. It may be that the social understanding of how to behave
                    as an individual during the pandemic is
                    more pertinent in the countries analysed above. Although mainly we can see that the coronavirus
                    propagates
                    more during the winter and receeds during the summer months, there is no evidence to suggest that
                    imposing a lockdown in these countries would greatly reduce
                    the amount of new coronavirus infections, although if it were evident that cases were out of control
                    then lockdowns would have been
                    a useful thing to implement but again, here there is no evidence to suggest that it is necessary.

                <h2 class="sub">Outlier: The United States of America</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">Taking a global scope of the toll of the coronavirus must always be inclusive of
                    such outliers, and as the US is something unto itslef
                    being almost as complicated as the entirety of Europe itself. The US has the most amount of cases in
                    the world, being 27,690,715 - almost 17 million more than
                    it's runner up India, whose population is 1,380,004,385 while the US population is 331,002,65.
                    Including such an outlier requires an individual analysis,
                    so I will compare the data here consisting of the US with it's 3 closest neighbours: Canada, Mexico
                    and Cuba, mapping out the dates
                    of lockdowns in the US by state, county and city, Mexico and Canada's lockdowns will be shown for
                    the whole counties as direct comparisons.

                    The below graph shows the daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases per million people in a 7 day rolling

                    <br>
                    We can see that the outbreak of the coronavirus in the US was constrained through the use of
                    lockdowns at the start of the pandemic.
                    There was another wave of cases that came about in the summer, which is uncommon for countries in
                    the northern hemisphere as we can see with Canada. This should have rung
                    alarm bells for the CDC with winter on its way later in the year. But by the time the winter came
                    around, there was only one state in the US that had implemented a
                    lockdown, which was California. It seems to have slowed the rate of infection, but after that
                    lockdown ended, the cases of new infections continued to rise. Now
                    with the weather starting to get a bit warmer, and maybe the citizens of the US being more conscious
                    of the risks that the coronavirus poses, the number of new cases
                    has slowed to just over 360 per million people. Canada and Mexico's lockdowns seem to have been
                    effective in containing the virus considering
                    the difference of new infections with the US, although the numbers are consistent with the
                    coronavirus being more problematic during the winter and Canada being further north
                    than Mexico, therefore more likely for more infections.

                    I have collated the unemployment rates (%) and real GDP growth of the countries analysed above, of
                    which play an integral role in
                    the mental health of the population, because if you have lost your work due to the pandemic it is
                    safe so assume that you will be experiencing

                    The economical and associated mental health toll that the coronavirus and associated lockdowns have
                    taken on the populations of
                    the countries in the evidential data displayed above is concerning, The single most pertinent issue
                    surrounding lockdowns is
                    their negative effects on the economy and the effects to mental health and wellbeing that they
                    amplify. This is a condition of the pandemic itself,
                    so the numbers may reflect the true toll of the coronavius in its complexity. It will be interesting
                    to see the data on how the pandemic has effected
                    the mental health of populations comparing different levels of lockdowns and no lockdowns, for the
                    real effects to be fully considered.
                    <br><br>
                    It is evident that the less lockdowns are imposed onto a country and the population, the better that
                    country's economy will be for it. Although
                    to have no recession in the economy at all and an increase in unemployment during this time is very
                    rare.

                    China put a harsh lockdown on Hubei province from the 23rd of January 2020 and the entire country
                    was closed along with all shopping centers and
                    public places, even Shanghai where I was working at the time. Temporary workers and tourists were
                    leaving China as fast as they could so they wouldn't
                    get stuck there or get sick because at that time the full scale of the danger was unknown. This
                    lockdown worked for China and they managed to get the
                    coronavirus under control in the country, and were able to fully open back up by the 8th of April. I
                    returned to Australia in February, which soon after went into
                    a national lockdown that ended on the 15th of May, lasting just under 2 months. Following this and
                    during the winter of the southern hemisphere there was
                    an increase in cases in the city of Melbourne where I was living and a long lockdown lasting for 111
                    days was implemented and only lifted once there
                    were zero new cases reported for 2 weeks in a row. Towards the end of the Melbourne lockdown 
                    I moved to Portugal for study, which had
                    implemented a lockdown earlier in the year for a couple of weeks.
                    This had some effect in slowing the rate of infection, although there was no need to continue to
                    enfore a lockdown as the summer was coming.
                    Recently Portugal has had to implement another lockdown on its citizens, which started on the 15th
                    of January 2021 because the amount of new cases per million
                    people dramatically increased over the winter for Portugal in the northern hemisphere and hospitals began to
                    become overloaded. Due to this lockdown cases have started to
                    drop dramatically, it was initially planned to end the lockdown on the 14th of February although it is 
                    possible that the lockdown may be extended for 2 more weeks. China had discovered some new outbreaks in Hebei province and has recently
                    implemented new lockdowns, while some cities in Australia
                    also implemented lockdowns after finding a few new cases of the coronavirus that only lasted no more
                    than five days.

                    As we can see above, China has not suffered too much from the pandemic, even though the coronavirus
                    originated there. Ausralia has suffered somewhat of a recession,
                    but as per usual, being a small population, so far away with a good economy it has not been effected
                    too greatly by the pandemic. Portugal on the other hand,
                    has suffered quite the blow to it's economy, being a popular tourist destination the coronavirus put
                    everyone's plans on hold indefinetely and with the very high amount
                    of new cases per million, it seems like it will take some time to recover once the pandemic is over,
                    if it ever ends.

                <h1 class="article">_<br>Conclusion</h1>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Lockdowns have been used effectively in a number of countries such as China and New Zealand and
                    Australia in an attempt to stamp out the coronavirus completely, which should be
                    the real goal for a lockdown. Although in a lot of cases this is not possible, it may be that the
                    coronavirus is already too far spread though the community in order to be able to
                    track thoroughly enough who has contracted it know as "contact tracing" or it may be that a lockdown
                    is not economically viable for the people living in the country. It does seem that
                    once the coronavirus has infected the population with many community transmissions, and is spread
                    throughout the country, it is not effective or worthwhile to try to abolish the coronavirus
                    completely through the use of lockdowns. I would not recommend imposing a lockdown unless the number of daily new cases gets out of control
                    like they had in Portugal and it was required in order to releive the strain on the healthcare system of the country. 
                    Due to the economic, social and mental health impacts of imposing
                    lockdowns, they are not a long term answer and there needs to be another way that is more socially
                    and economically appropriate to deal with the threat of a pandemic. Community awareness
                    is a key strategy, as is contact tracing when it can be done well and the population is compliant.
                    The coronavirus is a threat mainly during the winter months and gets better in the summer months of
                    the year, similar to influenza and this
                    should be taken into account when a government is considering a lockdown. 
                    It is also evident that psychological impacts along with 
                    domestic violence, suicide and other such unfortunate behaviours have increased as a direct result 
                    of lockdowns[8], and although data for these problems is not publicly available it is possible to correlate the data from 
                    unemployment rates and GDP with these issues. In some cases a lockdown
                    is not necessary at all and the pandemic can be handled with some light restrictions and good
                    community awareness but in others it is necessary, especially if the goal of the country is to 
                    completely eradicate the coronavirus without a vaccine.
